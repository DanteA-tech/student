1. Explaining:
 I felt like for my code I was able to explain all of my code accurately while being short concise. I did a lot of material including my feature, my feature backend, log in/ sign up, databases, and admin features. I felt I was able to explain this very well especially to people with very little experience in CSP and was able to answer questions from those with more experience. 
2. Tangibles:
I think my tangibles for night at the museum were extremely on point with me taking more a leadership role working on important aspects outside of my feature. I was able to show old versions of my features and my newest version and had everything working perfectly. Also, I was able to demonstrate the log in and sign up, the backend functionality, and the admin roles. I think I did especially well in this aspect since I stepped up for my group and worked on our foundations for our project outside of my feature. 
3. Preparation for event: 
Before the event I made sure I communicated with my group that I would be the only one commiting up until night at the museum since I did not want to potentially break our project. I made sure to have everything working in the front end and backend. Also, I went into my other's team members projects and briefly improved their functionality and appearance. Lastly, I was very clear with communicating my goals and showed up early to get everything ready.

1. Navigation and Formating: 
I think that the navigation of our project was pretty poor. I found myself often showing others how to navigate through the project and I think our project could've done with better navigation. Also, I think a homepage besides the timebox would've benefitted us aswell as instructions on the actual features. 
2. Planning:
 I think as a team our planning was pretty poor this caused me to have to do a code amount of work right before N@TM. I shoudl've demandedmy team mates code earlier to prevent myself from getting swamped with adding their features in last second. Also, I think overall, we could've planned our projects out since we were partly scrambling towards the middle and two of our members were missing a feature up until a couple days prior.
- ## Feedback: 
Some feedback I recieved/ noticed was especially for the poeple vieiwing the project that were not kids had no idea of what clash royale was. I was able to explain briefly what the game was, but they had very little understanding truly. I recieved feedback from one of the user's that the decks and card collection really dont serve a deeper purpose. I think it would've been cool to have some sort of a game related to Clash Royal. Lastly, som emore feedback was just easier navigation

## CSP:
After we finished our review I took the time to go look around the class at other projects that were after/during our time. The main projects I looked at were Saathvik's, Torin's, and Aidan Lau's from Mr. Lopez. Saathvik had a very cool project regarding real estate with a database with information about houses and teh ability to favorite house and locate house near you. Torin's project was very informational, but I especially liked the stock feature. I believe he had it where you can look up a stock and it gives you an in depth analysis of each stock. This could be very useful for people genuinly interested in stocks. Also, I believe he had a live crypto buying feature which was very interesting. Laslty, I viewed Aidan's job finder project. It inlvoves you registering for an account and it finds jobs available near you. Also, they added it where they will respond to you based on your application.
## Outside of CSP
I didn't really look at too much outside of CSP I just briefly went through the ceramics room to look at my sister and my friend's pottery, but I saw some very interesting pots, one from my friend who made a shark looking jar. Also, for the photos I went to go look at the photos that lincoln took and he took a very nice photo with a sunflower with a bee in the middle.
