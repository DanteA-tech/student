## final reflection
Overall, the trimester has certainly been something to remember. Both of my parent's jobs heavily contain code with my mom working for Union bank and my dad having over 20 years at Qualcomm(3D image processing), so taking this class was not negotiable. This class taught me many important things involving coding and taught me to work through my errors. My accomplishments include my solo projects towards the beggining of the year and my contribution to the passion project. My favorite memories from this class include our team teach, night at the musuem, and the relief that transfering to a new computer brought. A main way I could grow for next trimester is to simply listen to my teacher's feedback and prioritize their suggestions. My plans for the future are to continue building up my coding skills and work on my communication skills. I will do this through the class work and given outside resources
